2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net synchronization_primitive/wr_ins_dm is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin synchronization_primitive/wr_occupy_start_i_2/O, cell synchronization_primitive/wr_occupy_start_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PLHOLDVIO-2#1 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT synchronization_primitive/wr_occupy_start_i_2 is driving clock pin of 1 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. Involved cells are:
DMEM/wr_occupy_start_reg
Related violations: <none>

RPBF-3#1 Warning
IO port buffering is incomplete
