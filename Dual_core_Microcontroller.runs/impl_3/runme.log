WARNING: [Power 33-232] No user defined clocks were found in the design! Power estimation will be inaccurate until this is corrected.
Resolution: Please specify clocks using create_clock/create_generated_clock for sequential elements. For pure combinatorial circuits, please specify a virtual clock, otherwise the vectorless estimation might be inaccurate

WARNING: [DRC PDRC-153] Gated clock check: Net synchronization_primitive/wr_ins_dm is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin synchronization_primitive/wr_occupy_start_i_2/O, cell synchronization_primitive/wr_occupy_start_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
WARNING: [DRC PLHOLDVIO-2] Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations: A LUT synchronization_primitive/wr_occupy_start_i_2 is driving clock pin of 1 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. Involved cells are:
