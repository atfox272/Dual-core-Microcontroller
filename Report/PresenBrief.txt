Chapter 1: Overview

1. Introduce about Dual-issue Microcontroller:
-  64-bit risc-v microcontroller
	+ Dual issue
	+ System clock up to 40Mhz

- Harvard Architecture
=> 2 memory spaces
	+ Data Memory
	+ Program Memory

- Both of Data Memory & Program Memory are SRAM

- The Dual-issue microcontroller contains 8Kbits on-chip system memory for Data Memory and 2Kbits on-chip system for Program Memory

- 16 GPIOs & 2 UART peripherals & Internal/External Interrupts

- And some mechanism to handle with 2 issue processors

Chapter 2: Central Processing Unit
1. Overview:
- The CPU has 3 processors: 1 program processor & 2 issue processors.

<image: CPU.png>

- Program processor is multi-cycle-clock processor and processes instruction-fetch stage (consists of Instruction Fetch + Interrupt Detect + Instruction Dispatch)

- Two Issue processors are multi-cycle-clock processor and processes Execution stage (consists of Execution + Data memory access + Write back)

2. General purpose registers
- 32 general-purpose registers are 64-bit registers

	+ Stack pointer registers (x2 - 0xFF): to store the address of stack space
	+ Global pointer register (x3 - 0x2B): To store the address of global data space in Data memory.

3. Sequential Execution:

+ Program Processor: Yellow block
+ Issue Processor 1: Blue block
+ Issue Processor 2: Green block
* Without interrupt case, jump case

Chapter 3: Memories
1. Overview
- The microcontroller consists of 2 memory spaces	
	+ Data memory 
	+ Program memory 
2. Program memory
- 8Kbits on-chip system for program memory

<image:ProgramMemory_overview.png>

- Maximum of 256 instructions
	+ 208 instruction for main program
	+ 48 instructions for interrupt routines

- The program memory provides a half-alignment mechanism.
=> User can double-fetch instructions at any word base

3. Data memory
- 2Kbits on-chip system

- Data memory is separated into 3 spaces: 
	+ I/Os & peripherals configuration space
	+ Data space
	+ I/Os & peripherals space

- Data memory has 2 read-handler and 1 write-handler

Chapter 4: General-purpose I/Os
1. Overview:
- The Dual-issue microcontroller provides 16 digital I/O pins.

<image:GPIO_BlockDiagram.png>

- The PORTx bits access from 0x00000000000000 - 0x00000000000001
to set state of 8 pins of each port

- The PIN_BUFx bits are accessed from 0x40000000000000 - 0x40000000000001 to set pin's value (output state)

3. Alternate Port Function

3.1. Alternate Function of Port A

<image: AlternateFunction_PA.png>
+ EXTINT - Port A, Pin 2: EXTINT: External Interrupt source.

3.2 Alternate Function of Port B

<image: AlternateFunction_PB.png>
+ TLTF - Port B, Pin 1: Timer Flag will be toggled when the counter has reached the top of TIMER_LIMIT_VALUE.

Chapter 5: Interrupts
- The Dual-issue microcontroller provides 2 interrupt: external interrupt and internal interrupt.
- Each interrupt routine cannot have maximum of 16 instructions.

Chapter 6: External Interrupt

1. Some Features:
- Maskable interrupt
- Three sense control
- Debounce mechanism 

2. Overview:
- Trigged by PA2 pin (both output state and input state)
- Configuration register (EXTINT) is placed at 0x0D in Data Memory 
- User can configure sense of external interrupt; enable debounce mechanism 

3. Register description:

<image: configRegister_ExternalInterrupt.png>
- Bit 7: External interrupt enable
	+ Enable request of external interrupt 

- Bit 6 - 5: Sense Control
<image :ExternalInterrupt_SenseControl.png>

- Bit 4: Debounce option
	+ Enable / Disable

- Bit 3 - 0: Reserved

Chapter 6: 16-bit Timer/Counter 

1. Some feature:
- Clear timer when comparing match automatically.
- Timer counter's width is 16-bit
- 4 prescaler options
- Timer flag signal at PB1 pin

2. Register Description

2.1. Timer Interrupt Register

<image:configRegister_TimerInterrupt.png>
- Bit 7: Timer Interrupt Enable}
	+ Enable request of Timer Interrupt to Interrupt Controller
- Bit 6: Timer Flag Modes (TFM)
	+ If TFM is set to "1", the module will trigger when the counter reaches TIMLIM's value.
	+ If TFM is set to "0", the module will trigger when the counter is overflow
- Bit 5 - 3: Reserved 
- Bit 2 - 0: Prescaler Select Bit
